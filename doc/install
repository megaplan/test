Dependencies
============

The program has been built and tested on "Linux Mint 10 Julia".

compile depends:
- header files from rabbitmq-erlang-client, 2.3.1+hg20110303.1-0ubuntu2

run-time depends:
- beam files from rabbitmq-erlang-client, 2.3.1+hg20110303.1-0ubuntu2
- misultin, >= 0.6.2

Compilation
===========

To build all the parts of the project type make from the project top
level dir:

	make

Start
=====

1. Sender

Sender part is located in 'client' dir. Set parameters in nums.conf that
located in this dir to correct values.
There must be correct paths for beam files in the start script. These paths
are used with -pa keys and must contain all the modules necessary for sender.
Run nums.sh script from 'client' dir to start sender module:

	./nums.sh start

2. Receiver

Receiver part is located in 'server' dir. Set parameters in nums.conf that
located in this dir to correct values.
There must be correct paths for beam files in the start script. These paths
are used with -pa keys and must contain all the modules necessary for receiver.
Run nums.sh script from 'server' dir to start receiver module:

	./nums.sh start


Check
=====

After starting sender and receiver check for appropriate log files.
Default log files are located in client/log and server/log dirs.
Next step to check is opening the link http://localhost:8182/page1
in a browser. The page contains a form to complete. Fill in the form with
any URL and send it.
The sender should take filled data and send it to the receiver. The receiver
issues HTTP HEAD command for received URL and logs the response it gets.
